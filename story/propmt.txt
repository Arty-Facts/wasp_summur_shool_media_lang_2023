 Can you create a funny Sketch for Big Bang Theory using Sheldon Amy Leonard and Penny visiting this event:

 this should be a funny sketch  here are some things to make fun of:

  when presented with previous years submissions for the project Sheldon 
  is very unimpressed by the results and he  argue that the wasp   money should be spent on his research instead

 Nvidia made the presentation of their new gpus and of their new expensive Cloud solution 
 Leonard makes fun of it by saying that's how they solve the problem of it works 
 on my system by making sure that everybody uses their system because Leonard is always trouble with the nvidia the drivers

 Amy tries to find the positive aspects of the summer school but Sheldon Acts childish and
  doesn't want to collaborate with others when creating the project

 gets frustrated because none of the deep learning and generative models are grounded 
 in true facts in theory but everything is just stochastic exploration  for experimentalists.

 in the dome Making Magic film about computer graphics was fascinating but super scary when the dinosaur jumped from the screen

when working on the project make fun of how slow the server are for gesture generation. like it was make by a 5 year old monkey

this is the agenda for the event:

WARA Media & Language welcomes you to an exciting week of Summer School!


The format will be a combination of invited lectures from WASP researchers, industry experts and  
hands-on experience of central technologies.

During the week you will not only learn about, but also interact and experiment with, modern generative
 models of human behavior. This includes generative language models, text-to-speech systems, and gesture generation. 
 Outside of the lectures, students work in groups to use the above technologies to create a short story told by 
 3D avatars. The week is wrapped up by presentations of these assignments in the 3D dome at the Visualization Center.

Examples of last year’s student work can be found below:

Team 1

Team2 

Team 3

Team 4

The social program includes a welcome reception, an excursion, a pitch event and a conference dinner. There will be plenty of networking opportunities with fellow students and the larger WASP community.

Hope to see you there!

create a sketch with approximately 100 lines and 5 scenarios 

encode a sentiment for each line chose from:
Agreement, Angry, Disagreement, Distracted, Flirty, Happy, Laughing, Neutral, Old, Pensive, Relaxed, Sad, Sarcastic, Scared, Sneaky, Speech, Still, Threatening, Tired 

can you present it in json format 

[
  {
    "scenario": "...",
    "dialogue": [
      {
        "character": "Sheldon",
        "sentiment": "...",
        "line": "..."
      },
      {
        "character": "Amy",
